Hello, I'm Harrison Specht! I am a scientist using my training in chemistry, mass spectrometry and data science to satisfy my curiosity about biology. Currently, I am  a post-doctoral researcher in the [Slavov Laboratory](https://slavovlab.net) at Northeastern University where I am working on single cell proteomics methods both experimental and computational.  

## My research
I develop [methods](https://scope2.slavovlab.net) for measuring the abundance of proteins in single cells. Why is this cool? Proteins perform computation! I observe coordinated changes in protein abundances in many single cells to understand their decision making processes in healthy and diseased states. 

## My background and history
I received my Ph.D. working with [Nikolai Slavov](https://www.slavovlab.net) at Northeastern University and my B.A. in [Chemistry at Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu). Between my bachelor's degree and PhD., I was at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) as a Research Assistant in the Proteomic Platform. Additionally, I've done environmental mass spectrometry on tar from oil spills at the [Bermuda Institute for Ocean Sciences](https://www.bios.edu) and co-ops at Merck Exploratory Sciences and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. 

## My entrepreneurial directions
I want to use proteomics technology to make a difference for patients and the environment. One vehicle for doing this will be forming companies with the explicit directive of developing proteomics technology to solve a problem in disease or the effects of climate change. I completed the [NSF I-Corps Program](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/) at Northeastern University and was awarded $10,000 for prototype development and customer discovery.
