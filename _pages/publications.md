## [Single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of macrophage heterogeneity using SCoPE2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02267-5)

Published in _Genome Biology_, 2021. 

Single cell proteomics measurements of 500-1000 proteins per single cell and >3000 proteins across the thousands of human immune cells were made using SCoPE2. SCoPE2 is designed to be accessible to laboratories worldwide, using commercially available reagents and equipment.
